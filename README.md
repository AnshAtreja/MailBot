# MailBot
With the help of MailBot you do not have to worry about replying to your emails when you are busy for a few days. MailBot automatically fetches your unread emails and replies with a message letting the reciever know about your unavailability.

This app was created using Node.js. It uses the Gmail API to connect to your Gmail ID. It can read and reply to all of your unread emails with a custom message. You would need to create a project in Google Cloud Console to run this app.
